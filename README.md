# Machine Learning
Deep dive into data visualization, preprocessing, feature scaling, encoding and dimensionality reduction before feeding data into an ML algorithm.

## Contents:
1. Load data
2. Generate descriptivve stats
3. Visualize features using Seaborn
4. Impute missing values: Multivariate imputation (regression), KNN
5. Feature scaling: Normalization vs Standardization vs doing nothing
6. Encode categorical features
7. Data partitioning / Cross validation
8. Dimensionality reduction: Supervised vs Unsupervised
9. Running different models
10. Overfitting vs underfitting (bias/variance testing)
11. Hyperparameter tuning
12. Statistical analysis: Hypothesis testing, regression, binary vs multi-class
13. Performance visualization
14. Model deployment
